This project is a learning experience in HTML/CSS/Javascript (and jQuery).

I am going through The Odin Project's course on full-stack web development, with the current exercise of creating a way to dynamically populate a grid of the user's choice. The user must be able to color the grid boxes by mouseenter.

Lesson instructions and guidelines can be found here:

Note the basic requirements above. Added features not required.
